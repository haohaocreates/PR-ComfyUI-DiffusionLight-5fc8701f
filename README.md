# DiffusionLight implementation for ComfyUI

This is simplified implementation of the DiffusionLight (https://github.com/DiffusionLight/DiffusionLight) method of creating light probes.
You will need the included LoRA, place it in ComfyUI/loras folder like usual, it's converted from the original diffusers one (that won't work in Comfy as it is)

Example workflow is in the examples folder:
